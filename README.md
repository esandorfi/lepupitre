## Start here: the Audio Recorder - fastest way to improve

<p>
  <strong>Press record → speak → get feedback.</strong><br/>
  The Audio Recorder is the quickest entry into Le Pupitre’s training loop: capture a rehearsal, review pacing and structure,
  and iterate — <strong>without uploading your voice</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Train your <strong>opening</strong>, your <strong>timing</strong>, and your <strong>transitions</strong>—then save attempts to compare progress over time.
</p>



<p><strong>What you get immediately</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Duration + pace (WPM) at a glance</li>
  <li>Waveform + checkpoints for structure</li>
  <li>Optional local transcription (Whisper on-device)</li>
  <li>A saved, local history of attempts to track progress</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Local-first by default: audio, transcripts, and progress stay on your machine.</em></p>

## Who it’s for — and why Le Pupitre exists

If you speak for work or school—conference talks, product demos, pitches, team updates, or classroom presentations—Le Pupitre helps you train like it matters. Not by collecting notes, but by making progress visible: timing, pacing, structure, and iteration.

Most people don’t lack motivation—they lack a loop. Practice gets skipped, feedback is vague or delayed, and it’s hard to compare one run to the next. Le Pupitre gives you an evidence-based loop: **record → measure → improve → repeat → deliver**, all the way to **Jour J**.

And because voice data is sensitive, Le Pupitre is **local-first**: recordings, transcripts, and progress stay on your machine by default (with optional on-device Whisper). It’s also **open source**—community-driven and built in the open.

## How it works: from rehearsal to <strong>Jour J</strong>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="52%">
      <h3>1) Rehearse with live stats</h3>
      <p>
        Run a rehearsal and get immediate metrics: time, pace (WPM), and a clear view of what you’re doing well.
        The goal is not “more practice”—it’s <strong>better practice</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time & pace tracking</li>
        <li>Waveform + checkpoints</li>
        <li>Actionable feedback, not vague notes</li>
      </ul>
    </td>

    </td>
    <td width="52%">
      <h3>2) Prepare your content + plan your loop</h3>
      <p>
        Turn practice into a routine. Write talking points, rehearse, review, and schedule the next iteration.
        Consistency beats intensity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Talk writing and structured checkpoints</li>
        <li>Mentor / peer coaching moments</li>
        <li>Calendar-like planning for repeat runs</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="52%">
      <h3>3) Celebrate progress and share outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Keep momentum with visible progress and positive reinforcement. Share results when you want, and
        turn rehearsals into a real training routine.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear scoring (“Great Job!” moments)</li>
        <li>Shareable progress snapshots</li>
        <li>Progress that stays comparable across runs</li>
      </ul>

## Jour J: deliver with confidence

    </td>
    <td width="52%">
      <h3>On stage</h3>
      <p>
        The end goal is the moment that counts: a clear opening, strong key points, real engagement,
        and a confident closing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conference talks and meetups</li>
        <li>Product demos and pitches</li>
        <li>Team updates and keynotes</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="52%">
      <h3>In the classroom</h3>
      <p>
        “Mon Exposé” becomes a guided structure: introduction → ideas → conclusion.
        Great for students, teachers, and training contexts.
      </p>
    </td>
    <td width="48%">
      <img src="docs/images/app_screen_26_02_A.png" alt="Jour J classroom" width="520" />

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="48%">
      <img src="docs/images/app_screen_26_02_B.png" alt="Jour J online" width="520" />
    </td>
    <td width="52%">
      <h3>Online</h3>
      <p>
        Remote talks deserve the same clarity. Practice for video calls, webinars, and distributed teams,
        with audience reactions and pacing in mind.
      </p>
