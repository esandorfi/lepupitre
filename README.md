# Le Pupitre

Local-first Tauri coach for talks, pitchs, and presentations.
Practice your voice, keep your data local, improve every talk.

## Problems it solves
- Practice is irregular and hard to sustain.
- Feedback is often vague or delayed.
- Voice recordings and transcripts are sensitive.
- Progress is hard to measure across repeated runs.

## Why it is different
- Local Whisper transcription runs on your machine.
- Voice privacy by default: audio and transcripts stay local.
- Structured training loops: daily quests and Boss Runs.
- Actionable feedback for the next iteration.

## Who it is for
- Technical speakers
- Conference and meetup speakers
- Product and demo presenters
- Trainers, teachers, and workshop facilitators
- Anyone preparing spoken delivery with digital tools

## Install and run
- Download installers from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/esandorfi/lepupitre/releases).
