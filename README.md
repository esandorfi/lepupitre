# Le Pupitre

Local-first Tauri coach for technical talks: daily quests, Boss Runs, and actionable feedback.

## Why it exists
- Speaking quality improves with consistent practice loops.
- Feedback must stay private by default.
- Progress should work offline and remain under your control.

## What you can do
- Create profiles, talks, and training quests.
- Practice with text and audio flows, including Boss Run sessions.
- Review feedback and track progression.
- Export/import peer-review packs.

## Install and run
- Download installers from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/esandorfi/lepupitre/releases).
- macOS and Windows packages are built by CI.
- Current trust note for `v0.2.x`: installers may still show trust warnings until signing/notarization is fully enabled.

## Quick start
1. Create a profile.
2. Create a talk.
3. Complete a first quest (text or audio).
4. Run feedback and review the next actions.
