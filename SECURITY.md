# Security Policy

## Supported versions
Security fixes are applied to the latest maintained branch/release line.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please report vulnerabilities responsibly and avoid public disclosure before a fix is available.

Preferred process:
1. Open a private GitHub security advisory for this repository.
2. Include:
   - affected version/commit,
   - reproduction steps,
   - impact assessment,
   - potential mitigation if known.

If private advisory is not possible, contact maintainers privately and do not open a public issue with exploit details.

## What to expect
- Initial triage acknowledgment target: within 7 days.
- We will confirm impact, define a fix plan, and coordinate disclosure timing.
