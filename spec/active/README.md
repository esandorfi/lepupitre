# Active Specs

This folder contains active proposal documents that may still evolve.

Current groups:
- `product/`
- `ui/`
- `asr/`
- `help-content/`
- `site/`

Rules:
- These files are design input, not canonical implementation truth.
- When a proposal becomes implemented and approved, promote relevant rules into `docs/` and update `docs/STATUS.md`.
