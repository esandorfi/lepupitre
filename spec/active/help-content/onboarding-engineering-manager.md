## Why this matters

Leadership communication improves when decisions are explained with clear tradeoffs and outcomes.

## First-week routine

1. Define talk goal by context: status, roadmap, incident, strategy.
2. Practice concise opening and recommendation close.
3. Use feedback notes to track repeated clarity issues.
4. Rehearse one realistic 8-12 minute run before important meetings.

## Common mistakes

- Starting with implementation detail before decision framing.
- Mixing multiple goals in one talk.
- No explicit call to action at the end.

## Done when

- Listeners can repeat your decision, rationale, and next action in one sentence.
