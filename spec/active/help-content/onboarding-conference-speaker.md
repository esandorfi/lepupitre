## Why this matters

Stage talks require strong transitions, pacing control, and clear audience flow.

## First-week routine

1. Build or refine the outline with section-level intent.
2. Drill one difficult transition each day.
3. Alternate short quests and targeted section rehearsals.
4. Run one full timed Boss run and review pacing markers.

## Common mistakes

- Memorizing lines without breathing or pacing control.
- Overfocusing on intro and neglecting closing impact.
- Skipping full-length rehearsal until late.

## Done when

- You can keep timing and narrative coherence under one full-length run.
