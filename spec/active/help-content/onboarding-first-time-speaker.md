## Why this matters

You build confidence faster when you keep one talk scope and repeat often.

## First-week routine

1. Create one workspace and one talk.
2. Run one short daily quest.
3. Keep only two feedback actions for the next attempt.
4. Run one Boss run near the end of the week.

## Common mistakes

- Changing topic every day.
- Trying to fix everything in one session.
- Ignoring pacing while focusing only on wording.

## Done when

- You can deliver a stable 3-5 minute version without losing structure.
