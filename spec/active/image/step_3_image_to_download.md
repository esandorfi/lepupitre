Create a 16:9 SaaS website hero illustration for “Le Pupitre”.

STYLE LOCK (CRITICAL):

* Same visual style, same character design language, same palette and line system as previous image.
* Professional polished vector/cartoon style.
* Emoji-inspired expressive characters (not realistic humans).
* Rounded geometry, consistent line weight, clean shapes.
* Warm orange primary accent.
* Neutral interface tones.
* Subtle cyan data highlights.
* Soft controlled lighting.
* Premium startup marketing quality.

PRIMARY GOAL (CONVERSION-FOCUSED):
The illustration must naturally guide the viewer’s eye toward the app download area (Mac + Windows).
Composition should visually support a strong CTA.

VISUAL FLOW (VERY IMPORTANT):
Design the scene to create an eye path:

1. Speaker character (confidence + attention anchor)
2. Laptop / desktop screen showing Le Pupitre app
3. Download buttons (Mac / Windows) as the final visual destination

Use body direction, gaze direction, lighting, and composition lines to subtly point toward the download buttons.

MAIN SCENE:

* The speaker stands confidently near a large laptop or desktop displaying the Le Pupitre interface.
* Audience emoji-style characters watch positively from background or lower foreground.
* The speaker gesture or posture subtly directs attention toward the app screen.

APP REPRESENTATION:

* Interface visible but simplified:

  * rehearsal time
  * speaking pace
  * waveform
  * feedback checkpoints
* UI feels real but not overly detailed.

DOWNLOAD FOCUS:

* Clear illustrated download area integrated into the scene.
* Two clean buttons:

  * “Download for Mac”
  * “Download for Windows”
* Include subtle Mac and Windows symbols.
* Buttons should feel like the natural visual endpoint without dominating the artwork.

COMPOSITION RULES:

* 16:9 hero banner.
* Strong central visual hierarchy.
* Large clean negative space reserved for headline and CTA text overlay.
* Avoid clutter near text-safe area.
* Layered depth (foreground audience, mid speaker, background lighting).

EMOTIONAL TONE:

* Friendly, confident, modern.
* Professional SaaS energy.
* Speaker owns the moment; Le Pupitre empowers preparation.

AVOID:

* Meme or sticker aesthetics
* Random floating emojis
* Classroom/school atmosphere
* Heavy gradients
* Hyper-detail or realism
* Busy UI that competes with CTA

FINAL CONSISTENCY INSTRUCTION:
same universe as previous Le Pupitre illustrations, identical rendering style, character proportions, and color harmony.
