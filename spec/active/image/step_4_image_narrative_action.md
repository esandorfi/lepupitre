Excellent choice 👍 — a **narrative loop system** is exactly what makes modern SaaS illustrations feel intentional instead of random.

The idea is simple:

➡️ each hero image represents **one step in a repeating cycle**
➡️ together they tell a story of continuous improvement
➡️ users instantly understand: *train → improve → perform → repeat*

Below is a **complete system** you can reuse for all future Le Pupitre visuals.

# 🔁 Le Pupitre Narrative Loop System

## 🧭 The Core Story (always the same)

**Train → Receive Feedback → Speak → Connect with Audience → Repeat**

Every image you generate should represent one of these moments while keeping the same style universe.
