# Spec Workspace

`spec/` is the design workspace for architecture/product/UI proposals.

## What belongs here
- Early exploration and RFC-style proposals.
- Alternative options and tradeoff discussions.
- Draft content that is not yet the canonical implementation contract.

## What does not belong here
- Final operational runbooks and implementation truth.
- Decision logs that must live in ADRs.

## Status and lifecycle
- The lifecycle state of each spec file is tracked in `docs/STATUS.md`.
- Promotion, superseding, and archive rules are defined in `docs/DOCS_GOVERNANCE.md`.

## Precedence reminder
- If there is a conflict between `spec/` and canonical docs, follow `README*` + `docs/` + accepted ADRs.
