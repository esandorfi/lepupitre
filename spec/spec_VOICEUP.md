Plan for VOICE UP - push Le Pupitre to a first user audience

until now, we have a very technical solution and working.

with VOICE UP, the goal is to simplify the user goals, to have a macos/windows desktop app real integration, to leverage the gaming look and feel

--- main sections ---

i repeat the main screens : 

- Training -> a daily quest to practice the voice, the story telling, the talks architecture, etc... to push creating talk, challenge them to public, get feedback, iterate again...
in the training, we want to have a daily habits, and see gain in the usage, like a map to walk through, have credits some how, etc...

- Talks -> we  want to push the feeling to create a new talk, choose a subject, create the structure, challenge it via a framework a talk methods, challenge the speak and record, get feedbacks, make the talk public

- Feedbacks -> have the list as a timeline of the feedback, automatic generated from the voice and data we could generate (either in quest, in talks, in content, in voice, in real expert sending back feedback), the possibility to sync for feedback (import/export) to an expert (on the hub) or retrieve it (from the hub) as the owner of the talk

The secondary levels : 

- workspace : the user can have multiple theme (workspace) for it's training, talks, feedback
- import/export : import a feedback, send a feedback ask, export of talk - this is from the hub
- whisper settings
- connextion to the hub by login (user,pwd)
