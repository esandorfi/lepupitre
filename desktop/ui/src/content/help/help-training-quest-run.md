## Why this matters

Quest quality drives the quality of feedback and your next speaking decision.

## 3-step workflow

1. Choose one clear objective before recording or writing.
2. Capture one attempt with complete intent and request feedback.
3. Apply two feedback actions in the next repetition.

## Common mistakes

- Starting the attempt without a single practice objective.
- Switching format repeatedly before one full cycle is complete.
- Running many attempts without reviewing priorities.

## Done when

You can name the objective, the result, and the next two actions after each quest.
