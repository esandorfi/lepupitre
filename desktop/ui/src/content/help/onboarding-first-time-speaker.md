## Why this matters

Confidence grows faster when your scope stays stable and your practice is regular.

## 3-step workflow

1. Create one workspace and one talk for the whole week.
2. Run one short daily quest and request feedback.
3. Keep only two actions for the next attempt.

## Common mistakes

- Changing topic every day.
- Trying to fix everything in one session.
- Ignoring pacing while focusing only on wording.

## Done when

You can deliver a stable 3-5 minute version without losing structure.
