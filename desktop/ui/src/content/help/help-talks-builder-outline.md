## Why this matters

A clear outline reduces cognitive load during rehearsal and improves consistency across runs.

## 3-step workflow

1. Draft the talk in sections with one intent per section.
2. Validate transitions and simplify weak section boundaries.
3. Export and rehearse one section before full-run practice.

## Common mistakes

- Mixing several unrelated goals into one outline.
- Writing paragraphs instead of section prompts.
- Waiting to test transitions until late rehearsals.

## Done when

Each section has one clear intent and transitions can be spoken without searching for words.
