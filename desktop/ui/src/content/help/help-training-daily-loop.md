## Why this matters

A short daily loop compounds quickly when the feedback cycle stays focused.

## 3-step workflow

1. Pick the daily quest or a targeted alternate quest.
2. Submit text or audio and request feedback.
3. Carry only two priorities to the next attempt.

## Common mistakes

- Too many changes between attempts.
- No consistent quest cadence.
- Measuring progress only by score instead of behavior.

## Done when

You can state your top two improvements this week and point to them in recent attempts.
