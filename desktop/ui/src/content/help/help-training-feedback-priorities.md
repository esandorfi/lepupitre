## Why this matters

Feedback only compounds when you convert it into a small and repeatable next action set.

## 3-step workflow

1. Read the latest feedback once end to end.
2. Select the top two priorities that change delivery behavior.
3. Re-run the closest matching quest while those priorities are fresh.

## Common mistakes

- Turning every comment into an action immediately.
- Tracking score only and ignoring behavioral signals.
- Waiting too long before the next attempt.

## Done when

Your next attempt clearly targets two priority actions from the previous feedback.
