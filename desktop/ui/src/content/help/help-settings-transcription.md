## Why this matters

Reliable transcription settings improve feedback quality while keeping your workflow local-first.

## 3-step workflow

1. Verify sidecar and model status before a focused practice block.
2. Select the mode and language setup that matches your session.
3. Recheck output quality after changing model or mode.

## Common mistakes

- Assuming transcription is active without checking model status.
- Switching settings for every attempt without reason.
- Ignoring repeated timeout or missing-model errors.

## Done when

You can run a complete text or audio quest with deterministic transcription behavior.
