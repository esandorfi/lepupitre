## Why this matters

Packs let you exchange feedback artifacts without moving your full workspace data.

## 3-step workflow

1. Export a pack from a run that has useful feedback context.
2. Share the pack file with your reviewer and import their return pack.
3. Review imported notes and convert them into your next practice priorities.

## Common mistakes

- Exporting from unfinished runs with low signal.
- Losing track of which feedback round a pack belongs to.
- Importing without checking run context first.

## Done when

You can trace an imported review back to the exact run and apply it in your next session.
