## Why this matters

Leadership communication improves when decisions are framed with tradeoffs and expected outcomes.

## 3-step workflow

1. Define the talk goal by context: status, roadmap, incident, or strategy.
2. Practice a concise opening and recommendation close.
3. Track repeated clarity issues in feedback notes.

## Common mistakes

- Starting with implementation details before decision framing.
- Mixing multiple goals in one talk.
- Ending without a concrete call to action.

## Done when

Listeners can repeat your decision, rationale, and next action in one sentence.
