## Why this matters

Stage talks depend on strong transitions, pacing control, and clear audience flow.

## 3-step workflow

1. Refine the outline with section-level intent.
2. Drill one difficult transition each day.
3. Run one full timed boss run and review pacing markers.

## Common mistakes

- Memorizing lines without breathing and pacing control.
- Overfocusing on intro and neglecting closing impact.
- Skipping full-length rehearsal until late.

## Done when

You can keep timing and narrative coherence under one full-length run.
