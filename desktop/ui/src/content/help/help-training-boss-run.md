## Why this matters

Long-form rehearsal validates pacing and narrative coherence under realistic pressure.

## 3-step workflow

1. Record one uninterrupted run close to target duration.
2. Review transcript and feedback for pacing and transition breaks.
3. Schedule one focused quest before the next full run.

## Common mistakes

- Running long sessions too often without targeted short drills.
- Stopping the run for minor mistakes.
- Reviewing only wording and not timing.

## Done when

You can complete a full run at stable pacing and keep the narrative through the close.
