# Codex Agent Rules

This file is for agent behavior only.

Repository contribution/process gates are defined in:
- `docs/CONTRIBUTION_RULES.md`

## 1) Canonical docs on explicit request
When asked to update top-level docs, update:
1. `README.md`
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## 2) Rule precedence for agent actions
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/CONTRIBUTION_RULES.md`
3. `docs/DOCS_GOVERNANCE.md`
4. `docs/STATUS.md`

## 3) Output format
- Start delivery responses with a conventional commit title line.
- If checks/tests cannot run, state this explicitly.
