## Master prompt to recreate this as an “action workflow” (consistent style + full storyboard)

```text
Create a coherent illustrated storyboard for an app called “Le Pupitre” (French UI), showing a complete action workflow from practice to final presentation day (“Jour J”). Generate a set of 10 images, all in the SAME visual style, with recurring characters and consistent UI language.

STYLE (must stay consistent across all images):
- Warm, friendly, hand-painted cartoon / storybook look; soft watercolor texture; gentle grain; subtle vignette.
- Rounded characters with simple facial features (big eyes, blush cheeks), clean outlines, soft shading.
- Lighting: warm spotlights, bokeh glow, cozy atmosphere.
- Color palette: warm oranges/ambers + teal accents + cream backgrounds; avoid harsh neon or realistic photo lighting.
- Composition: cinematic depth (foreground audience heads / midground action / background glow).
- UI elements: simple, clean panels with rounded corners; orange header bar with “Le Pupitre”; teal waveform and checkmarks; readable French labels.

RECURRING CHARACTERS:
- Main presenter: young person with brown hair, orange shirt, wearing a headset mic, enthusiastic gestures.
- Supporting presenter: blonde person wearing headset mic, calm and focused.
- Supporting cast: classmates/audience with varied hair colors; occasional mentor/teacher figure.

DELIVERABLES (10 images, 2048x1365, 3:2 landscape):
1) “Live rehearsal + analysis overlay”: presenter at podium with audience; big Le Pupitre UI panel on the left with Rehearsal Stats (Time + Pace/WPM), waveform, Speech Analysis checklist (Clear Opening, Key Points, Engagement, Strong Closing).
2) “Empty stage anticipation”: podium and mic under spotlight, audience waiting.
3) “Desktop download hero”: laptop showing Le Pupitre UI; presenter gesturing; large CTA buttons “Download for Mac” and “Download for Windows”.
4) 4-panel collage: desk practice → 95% Great Job score → stage speaking → audience applause with sparkle bubble.
5) 4-panel collage: writing talking points → cross-device download on phone → mentor coaching conversation → calendar planning/checklist.
6) 4-panel collage: “Best Winner!” trophy celebration → sharing results on phones with social/video bubbles → 95% Great Job feedback moment → “Publish” network/map dashboard scene.
7) “Jour J stage finale”: big “JOUR J” banner, two presenters at podium, cheering audience, floating reaction icons.
8) “Jour J classroom”: banner “JOUR J”, student presenting; board text “Mon Exposé” with checklist: Introduction, Idées clés, Conclusion; teacher and students.
9) “Jour J online”: videoconference UI (Meet-like) with participant tiles; presenter shares “Mon Exposé” slide with an upward chart; reaction bubbles (thumbs up, applause).
10) “Speaker’s Journey map”: parchment map titled “Speaker’s Journey” with dotted path and labeled milestones: Daily Training, Talk Writing, Feedback, Challenging, and final destination “JOUR J” with a tiny podium scene.

TEXT RULES:
- Keep text minimal, clear, and readable.
- Use French product name “Le Pupitre” and “Mon Exposé / Jour J”.
- Do not introduce new brand names besides Le Pupitre.

CONSISTENCY RULE:
- Maintain identical character designs, palette, UI styling, and lighting across all 10 images.
- The app UI should look like the same product in every appearance (orange header, teal waveform, checkmarks, rounded cards).
```

If you want, I can also rewrite that master prompt into **10 separate per-image prompts** (same “style bible” + one scene each), which often improves consistency when generating them one-by-one.
